To revert your local changes and get your code back to the state of the last
commit pushed to GitHub, you can follow these steps:
1. Discard all local changes:
This will discard any changes in the working directory and index:
git reset --hard HEAD
2. Ensure your local branch matches the remote branch:
This will ensure that your local branch is in sync with the remote branch,
effectively discarding any commits that were not pushed.
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
Make sure to replace main with the name of your branch if it's different.
Here's the combined command sequence:
git reset --hard HEAD
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
After running these commands, your local repository should match the state of the
last commit pushed to GitHub. Be cautious, as these commands will discard any
local changes permanently.
